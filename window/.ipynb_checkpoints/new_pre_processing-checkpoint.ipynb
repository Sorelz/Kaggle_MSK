       "'We found three mutations in three ESCC primary tumors (Fig. 2 ⇓ ; Table 2 ⇓ ) and one mutation in a tumor cell line (Table 2) ⇓ . The amino acid changes in the mutations were R102K, A242T,  placeholderMutation and S623N. We also analyzed the blood DNAs from the three patients with mutations in the RNF6 gene, and all contained the wild-type allele (Fig. 2) ⇓ , thus indicating that the mutations in the ESCC primary tumors were acquired during tumorigenesis in somatic cells. RNF6 contains three domains: an arginine domain (amino acids 292–424), a poly-aspartic acid domain (amino acids 598–601), and a Zinc finger domain (amino acids 632–673). The mutation S623N, which is located near the Zinc finger domain, may affect its DNA-binding activity. Both A242T and  placeholderMutation may perturb the structure and function of the RNF6 protein. In the first case, the side chain of amino acid Thr is larger than the amino acid Ala. In the second case, the amino acid substitution gains a negatively charged residue.'"
